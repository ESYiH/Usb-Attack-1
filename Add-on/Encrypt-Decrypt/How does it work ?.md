Ok so here i will explain how the files work

the encrypt file remove the extension (renaming them )

and the decrypt file put back the extension (renaming them )

Because the pc need to have the extension and the user is curious to read what's on the usb key he will accept or try to change manually the extension but the user will just corrupt the file, nevermind
