Here I will explain what the code do, if you want to learn i let you search on internet :) (you can also text me on discord)

The goal of this couple of files is to disable [windows defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Defender) & [UAC](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/uac-why-you-should-never-turn-it-off/)

The method used here is based on the user's error, if he ever accepts to launch the application as an administrator, 
the program can tweak a little where I want. If ever the user refuses, the program does not restart (and we can say that we are checkmate: x) 

basically as you can see lot of files are [batch files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) (.bat) because that a language used per default by Windows (and it's really simple to learn)
