Here I will explain how the code work.

The goal of this couple of files is to disable [windows defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Defender) & [UAC](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/uac-why-you-should-never-turn-it-off/)

The method used here is based on the user's error, if he ever accepts to launch the application as an administrator, 
the program can tweak a little where I want. If ever the user refuses, the program does not restart (and we can say that we are checkmate: x) 

basically as you can see lot of files are [batch files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) (.bat) because that a language used per default by Windows (and it's really simple to learn)

"Nice i run it on my own pc, what should i do now ?"

~~just send me 100 bitcoins at the following adr..~~

Ok so just press windows key, tape "uac" press enter and put the button where u want. 
close the uac windows and press again windows key, tape "defender" click on "virus and threat protection" and navigate in the windows to put it work again (it's very simple, there is a huge button, click on it)
