1) copy the files
2) put it in your usb key (any key will do)
3) use a software to put "Start+PB.bat" as an .inf (autorun when the key is plug) i recommand [SamLogic](https://www.samlogic.net/usb-autorun-creator/usb-autorun-creator.htm)
4) (optinal) put all the files in hide mode (you can find how [here](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-hide-files-and-folders-windows-10))
5) eject the key
6) all is setup
