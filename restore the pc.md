"Nice i run it on my own pc, what should i do now ?"

~~just send me 100 bitcoins at the following adr..~~

Ok so just press windows key, tape "uac" press enter and put the button where u want. 
close the uac windows and press again windows key, tape "defender" click on "virus and threat protection" and navigate in the windows to put it work again (it's very simple, there is a huge button, click on it)

do not forget to restart your pc after this manipulation, before using your pc normally
